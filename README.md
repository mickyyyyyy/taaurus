# Taaurus
All the project files for our websites.

## Formatting

### Minimum Files
Each website must have the bare minimum files:
  - A main markup file for structure in HTML, and
  - A main style file in CSS.

### Subfolders
Websites that use images or fonts will have their files contained within subfolders.

### Naming
As a naming convention, Taaurus will need a naming convention, as such:
  - The main markup file in HTML will be titled 'index.html',
  - The main style file in CSS will be titled 'style.css'.
